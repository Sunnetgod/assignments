        <h2>My Autobiography</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            My name is Frank; well if name is to represent how one is most<br />
            popularly identified, I would say my name is Sunnet. And yes that <br />
            is true in the correct sense of the function. I should be more <br />
            known as Sunnet than as Frank to the best of my knowledge
          </p>
          <h2>How it all started</h2>
          <p>
            It all began at the ending past of my university years, say the ultimate years. <br />
            I had just seen a friend reading a C programming Language and he is not even <br />
            studying computer science in the university. I got inspired and borrowed the PDF, <br />
            although I didnt have a laptop as at that moment but I already knew what I was <br />
            going to use my time for during NYSC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just before compiling my undergraduate project I got a laptop gift, and ofcourse <br />
            I downloaded into a folder, all those resources for the programming Language. <br />
            After my project, I started reading, I made some progress with C.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, during NYSC, the epileptic power supply in those rural areas somehow<br />
             destroyed my laptop hard disc booting files. hence my laptop was bad for the most <br />
             part of my service years and I couldnot do much. 
          </p>
          <p>cut the long story short, I fixed the laptop as soon as it was properly diagnosed <br />
             and I had the money to change it, but after NYSC, armed rubbers broke into my home<br />
             and picked my new phone and my newly repaired laptop. But luckily, one of my <br />
             brothers was around, at the same time, getting ready to tavel back to the FCT where<br />
             he lived with his family, without hesistation, I left with him. I had access to his laptop,<br />
             I downloaded more resources that included frontend languages pack, started studying, <br />
             and this I could say was my very beginning to programming and software development world<br />    
          </p>
          <p>Finally I would like to add, never to take the above information literally, I know how much <br />
            impression my pen could make on my readers. Please, Im just trying to do my assignment as best<br />
            as I could to create content enough for the page functionality that i want to achieve. <br />Thanks

        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>Fast forward from my last section chunk of history to now where I will be telling you why I joined ALTSCHOOL. </p>
        <p>All my life I wanted to create solutions and automate them. I understand the power of the automation <br />
          is the power of multiplication of a resources for more utility. I wanted to be able to automate my processes,<br />
          whatever carreer path that I will take, whatever solution that I come up with, I want to be able to make it <br />
          available to large amount of people at a very short pace. This motivated me to go into software engineering <br />
          to have the certificate that could first affect my own life and then others
